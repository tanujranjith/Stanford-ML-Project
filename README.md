# Project Description

A machine learning project done as part of the Stanford Pre-Collegiate Intro to Machine Learning program, used the Adult Income dataset from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository to predict whether a person's income exceeds $50K/year. Did data cleaning, label encoding, exploratory data analysis, and feature preprocessing to prepare the dataset for model training. Models used were:

Tuned AdaBoost
 Gradient Boosting
 XGBoost

 Tuned Gradient Boosting
 Tuned Bagging Classifier
 Random Forest
